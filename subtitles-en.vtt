Hello everyone and welcome back to my channel!

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Today I'll be showing you my daily skincare routine.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.000
I'll be discussing CeraVe products and how I use them.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
The first step in my routine is makeup removal, which is very important.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.000
I use a gentle makeup remover that doesn't irritate the eyes and effectively cleans makeup.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.000
The second step is cleansing the skin with a hydrating cleansing gel.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
I like the CeraVe cleansing gel because it doesn't dry out the skin.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.000
After cleansing, I apply a toner to balance the skin's pH.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.000
Then I use a hyaluronic acid serum for deep hydration.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Finally, I apply a moisturizer to seal in all the previous steps.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Don't forget that sun protection is essential every day!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.000
This routine has helped me significantly improve my skin's appearance.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
Thank you for watching and I invite you to share your routine!
